# stories
Stories is a Jenkins plugin and is a validator for checking the quality of a backlog (checking all user stories). 

We want to apply the same principles we apply to code quality to the input (the product backlog). 
With Stories we are able to determine the "coverage" of a backlog. 

Things we meassure:
* Is the user story format used?
* Is the story estimated?
* What is the age of story (with a threshold of x week)
* When is the story mutated?
* Does the story include acceptance criteia (Gherkin)
* Are all storie linked to an Epic?
